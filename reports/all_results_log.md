## Fraud Detection Team Report
- **Transaction ID(s):** TXN0095
- **Risk Score, Classification, and Confidence Level:** 55, MEDIUM, Medium
- **Evidence Summary:** The transaction of $275.00 at "Moscow Chic" is consistent with a typical purchase in the luxury fashion category. The timing and geographical location align with normal consumer behavior. Historical data includes high-value transactions over $800.00 in the same geographical area, suggesting a potential fraud strategy involving high-value spending. However, this transaction amount is reasonable for luxury spending, indicating it might be a legitimate purchase.
- **Mitigating Evidence:** The geographic consistency (both the user and merchant are in Moscow) supports legitimacy. There is also a lack of recent, frequent transactions that could raise red flags.
- **Final Recommended Action:** flag for review
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-05T12:00:00Z

## Fraud Detection Team Report
- **Transaction ID(s):** TXN0082

- **Evidence Summary:** The target transaction amount of $320.00 exceeds the user's historical transaction amounts, which range from $1.70 to $3336.18, indicating a significant deviation. The merchant category of online gambling is also associated with higher fraud risk, and although the geographical location is familiar, the transaction timing is less typical for gambling activity.

## Fraud Detection Team Report
- **Transaction ID(s)**: [insert Transaction ID here]
- **Risk Score, Classification, and Confidence Level**: 75, HIGH, Medium
- **Evidence Summary**: The target transaction of $400 for online gambling at "Jackpot City" is significantly higher than the user’s historical transaction amounts, which typically range around $5. This substantial increase, alongside the high-risk merchant type, raises concern as the user has primarily engaged in casual spending within a consistent geographical area (Charlotte, NC).
- **Mitigating Evidence**: The geographic consistency to Charlotte, NC provides some legitimacy; however, it does not outweigh the unusual transaction amount and the high-risk nature of the merchant.
